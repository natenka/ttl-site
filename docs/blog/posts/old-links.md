## Refactoring

### Refactoring Kata

Refactoring Kata is a small task that has already been solved, but the code
is not very beautifully written. The task is to rewrite the code more
beautifully. At the start there can be just a lot of conditions, and at the end
a beautiful design, classes, etc. Ideally, it is better to write tests for the
starting code, so it will be much easier to redo the code and know that nothing
has broken.

Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata is one such task. [More about the task, code and requirements for the task and tests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).


After solving this particular problem, I highly recommend watching the video
[All the Little Things by Sandi Metz](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE).
In the video, this problem is solved in Ruby, but Ruby is similar enough to
Python that the concept is understandable.  The main thing is to watch the
video from the beginning to the end, not only the solution, because it is in
the process of how the decision was reached that there are a lot of important
things.
